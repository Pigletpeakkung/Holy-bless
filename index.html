Every pain you have experienced, every heartbreak you have endured, every loss you have suffered has created an opening through which divine love can pour into your being. What you thought was breaking you was actually making you whole. The cracks in your heart are not signs of weakness but gateways to wisdom. Through your wounds, you learn compassion. Through your struggles, you discover strength. Through your darkness, you find the light that was always there, waiting patiently for you to notice its presence.",
